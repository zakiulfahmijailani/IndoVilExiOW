# IndoVilExiOW
IndoVilExiOW is a unique tool designed to facilitate the extraction and exploration of individual village polygons across Indonesia by harnessing the power of OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Wikipedia data sources. With Indonesia's vast geographical diversity and rich cultural heritage, accurate village boundary data is essential for various applications such as geographic information systems, urban planning, and disaster management. This tool use the Indonesian village names web-scrapped from Wikipedia to retrieve village polygons from OpenStreetMap in bulk automatically. 

The names were web-scraped from Wikipedia, compiled in the dataset daftar_kelurahan.xlsx. This Excel file contains three columns: 'kelurahan' (village name), 'provinsi' (province), and 'negara' (country). The dataset is the result of the method described here: https://github.com/zakiulfahmijailani/Indonesia_Kelurahan_Names_From_Wikipedia.
